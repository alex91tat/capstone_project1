        <h4>FPGA PS/2 Keyboard Controller</h4>
        <a href="https://github.com/alex91tat/Ps2-Keyboard-Controller"
          >GitHub Link</a
        >
        <p>
          Designed and implemented an FPGA-based PS/2 keyboard controller that
          processes key inputs and displays characters on a seven-segment
          display. Developed a system to store and manipulate up to four
          characters, enabling cursor movement, selective deletion, and
          real-time updates using arrow keys, backspace, and enter. Utilized
          serial-to-parallel data conversion, parity checking, and state machine
          logic for efficient input handling. Optimized hardware components such
          as frequency dividers, registers, and multiplexers to ensure smooth
          operation. Demonstrated proficiency in digital design, VHDL, and FPGA
          development on the Basys 3 board.

        <p>
          The Car Repair Shop simulation is a comprehensive software application
          designed to manage the operations of a car repair system. This project
          allows users to handle various aspects of a car repair shop, including
          managing customers, employees and car information, tracking services
          performed, and updating the status of cars undergoing repair. Includes
          a secure login page to authenticate users before accessing the system,
          ensuring privacy and security. The application is built with
          Object-Oriented Programming principles to ensure modularity,
          maintainability, and scalability, allowing for future extensions and
          improvements. The system follows a CRUD architecture, providing users
          with full control over the data. Users can add, retrieve, modify, and
          delete different types of data through an intuitive interface. The
          application also integrates with a database to store and retrieve
          critical information, ensuring persistent data storage and seamless
          user experience. Technologies used: Java, Java Swing, PostgreSQL.

        <h4>Alcohol Detection and Face Recognition System</h4>
        <a href="https://github.com/alex91tat/Alcohol-Detection-System"
          >GitHub Link</a
        >
        <p>
          Developed an Arduino-based Alcohol Detection System for security and
          drunk driving prevention. Integrated an MQ3 alcohol sensor to measure
          alcohol levels, categorizing results as sober, legal limit, or drunk.
          Implemented a face recognition module in Python for user verification.
          Designed a feedback system using an RGB TFT LCD, buzzer, and mini
          motor for real-time alerts. Engineered hardware interactions through
          analog and digital pin configurations, ensuring reliable sensor data
          acquisition and response automation. Demonstrated expertise in
          embedded systems, sensor integration, and microcontroller programming.
          Technologies used: C/C++ (Arduino), Python.
